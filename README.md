# Maximum_Path_Sum_With_Prime_Check
Project Euler - Problem 18  with prime number check

Please name the input file as "input.txt".

You will have a triangle input below and you need to find the maximum sum of the numbers according to given rules below;

- You will start from the top and move downwards to an adjacent number as in below.
- You are only allowed to walk downwards and diagonally.
- You can only walk over NON PRIME NUMBERS.

```
   1
  8 4
 2 6 9
8 5 9 3
```

As you can see this has several paths that fits the rule of NOT PRIME NUMBERS; 1>8>6>9, 1>4>6>9, 1>4>9>9 1 + 8 + 6 + 9 = 24. As you see 1, 8, 6, 9 are all NOT PRIME NUMBERS and walking over these yields the maximum sum.
